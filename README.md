**LIEE DIFF-SVC AI** is a commercially mass-produced multi-language android developed by scientists for the intentions of companionship and entertainment. Though not all LIEEs have the capability, the newer model androids called "**L**earning and **I**nference **E**xampl**E**" have been able to uncannily simulate human emotion, especially through singing.
